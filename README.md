##  I only had basic knowledge on html. In these four days, I had to learn javascript, vuejs, css as well. Also I had no prior experience of using github, I had to learn about git repository and other facts in these 4 days. Though I started to follow a blog alongside a youtube channel about restful api, due to lack of time, I could not learn about restful api fruitfuly, That's why I could not fulfill the tasks you have given to me.
